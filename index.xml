      <description>I recently finished my first rust project - a command line utility called &amp;ldquo;bandwhich&amp;rdquo; that displays network utilization information. As a newcomer to rust, this project offered quite some challenges for me. This post is a write up of one of them, going into detail on the parts that I personally found most difficult to understand. I hope it will be the first of many. If you&amp;rsquo;d like to check out the utility itself and browse its source, you can find it here</description>

      <description># A talk I gave at Rust Linz Here&amp;rsquo;s a recording of a talk I gave at the virtual Rust Linz meetup. The talk is about Zellij (then called Mosaic).
# Adding package-lock.json support to yarn Back when I worked a lot in the javascript space, I thought it would be great if the then two major package managers supported each other&amp;rsquo;s lockfile format. This is a post I wrote after implementing support for npm&amp;rsquo;s package-lock.</description>

      <description># bandwhich 
Bandwhich was my first major Rust project. My main goal with it was to create a tool that would be trivial to use, providing useful information for network veterans and novice computer users alike.
My favorite feature about it is that the UI changes when the user expands their terminal window: showing more information (additional tables and additional columns in each table) if there&amp;rsquo;s enough room for it.</description>
