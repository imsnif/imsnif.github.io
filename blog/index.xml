      <description>I recently finished my first rust project - a command line utility called &amp;ldquo;bandwhich&amp;rdquo; that displays network utilization information. As a newcomer to rust, this project offered quite some challenges for me. This post is a write up of one of them, going into detail on the parts that I personally found most difficult to understand. I hope it will be the first of many. If you&amp;rsquo;d like to check out the utility itself and browse its source, you can find it here</description>
